# game

small game about violent rectangles. the game is that you move around and enemies follow you. if the enemies touch you, you die - but not if you touch them first. there is also a crosshairs that shoots at your position, but can also shoot at the enemies

if enemies are in a line in front of you you can dash through them killing everyone in the line. killing an enemy also kills any enemies standing adjacent to it. combine these two rules and you can kill all enemies in a 3x? row
