small game about violent cubes. the game is that you move around and enemies follow you. if the enemies touch you, you die - but not if you touch them first

if enemies are in a line in front of you you can dash through them killing everyone in the line. also if there are three enemies in a row in front of you moving into the first one kills the two next to them as well
